# AJAX

# AJAX is a developer's dream, because you can:

    * AJAX is not a programming language.
    * AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.
    * AJAX is a technique for accessing web servers from a web page.
    * Read data from a web server - after the page has loaded
    * Update a web page without reloading the page
    * Send data to a web server - in the background

# AJAX just uses a combination of:
    A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data  from a web server)
    JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)

1. An event occurs in a web page (the page is loaded, a button is clicked)
2. An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript
3. The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server
4. The server processes the request
5. The server sends a response back to the web page
6. The response is read by JavaScript
7. Proper action (like page update) is performed by JavaScript
